Part 1:
Did you describe the problem you are trying to solve?
    Trying to make online banking an easier process for customer. Quick transfer of money, easy withdrawal, etc.
Did you describe any input data you expect to use?
    Text input for password, username, etc, integer input for currency amount
Did you describe what the program will do to solve the problem?
    It will make it easier for customer to access their bank account and move money around
Did you describe any outputs or results the program will provide?
    It will move money to different accounts with receipts, and will provide details of bank account if asked


Part 2:
Did you write down clear and specific steps to solve a simple version of your problem you identified in Part 1?
    Make a bank class -> Make User class. User class has attributes which allow bank customer to solve problems identified
Did you state any necessary input data for your simplified problem?
    For customer -> First Name, Last Name, Username/Account number, Password, Checking/Savings Number, Current Balance, Function to Add Money, Function to Withdraw Money, Function to Transfer Money, and Function to Login
Did you write clear and specific steps in English (not Java) detailing what the program will do to solve the problem?
    It will allow customer to create/login to their account, add money within their account, withdraw money, and transfer to other accounts all within the app.
Did you describe the specific result of your example/scenario?
    Allow customer to save time by not having to drive to bank. Makes transfering money to other people much simpler

PART 3: Generalizing Into Pseudocode
Did you write out the general sequence your program will use, including all specific examples/scenarios you provided in Part 2?
    Class Bank {
        ArrayList<User/Customer> customers;

        public void login(String userNameGiven, int accountNumberGiven, String password) {
            //Prompt user to enter info & can't get passed screen until correctly inputted

            //Ask customer for userName or accountNumber and check password
                //If password incorrect ask customer to reenter info
            //If correct print account info and ask what customer would like to do
        }
    //Bank has all user data
        Class User/Customer {
            String first;
            String last;
            //Identify account by accountNumber &/or userName
            String userName;
            int accountNumber;
            String password;
            int checkingAccount;
            int balance;

            public void addMoney(int amount) {
                //Add money to checkingAccount balance

                //Print result
            }
            public void withdrawMoney(int amount) {
                //Remove money from checkinAccount balance

                //Print result
            }

            public void transferMoney(int amount, int accountNumber, String userName) {
                //Check customer list and check if accountNumber & userName match with a customer
                    //If no match print failed and retry
                //If match -> access the account and add amount to checkingAccount
                    //Print success
            }

            public void logOut() {
                //Exit program
            }
        }
    }

Did you write pseudocode for the program in English but refer to Java program elements where they are appropriate?
Does the pseudocode represent the full functionality of the program, not just a simplified version?
Is the pseudocode broken down enough that the details of the program are no longer in any paragraph form?
